                <p>When filming season 1 of The Mandalorian, the crew used large LED walls to project 3D environments made using Unreal Engine. The environments were then tracked to the movement of the camera, which meant that the environment would move at the same time as the camera’s to create the effect of being on a real set. This mixed reality approach had a few benefits to the filming compared to a green screen set.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>The actors were able to immerse themselves much more easily.</li>
                <li>Reflective material (like the Mandalorian’s helmet) would be able to reflect the actual environment being used, which saves a ton of time in post-production.</li>
                <li>The crew could adjust the environments on the fly during the filming, ranging from adjustments in the lighting, weather conditions, and virtual props.</li>

                <p>SafeZone is an AR app that helps keep their users safe from COVID in crowded areas. SafeZone scans an area using the camera to record the amount of people and the average distance between people. This, combined with local medical data, is then used to determine whether the area the user is looking at is safe to be in. The app displays this in the phone&#39;s camera view to visualize the risk the user has of contracting COVID by being in the scanned. </p>

                <p>I think XR is a very intriguing topic with a lot of potential, but I also think the people that talk about its countless practical applications and powerful capabilities to immerse are kind of undermining the fact that the technology isn&#39;t that far along yet. The tech we have right now is expensive and kind of clunky, and at the moment I think that for most consumers and companies it&#39;s just too much of an inconvenience to justify implementing it into their daily lives. Ignoring all of this though, I think that XR has a very bright future, as long as there are enthusiasts out there that are thinking of new and creative ways to use the technology.</p>
