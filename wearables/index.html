                <p>Case 1: Reimagine your phone without an interface. Can you think of an interactive wearable concept that has not been mentioned in the lecture based on a smartphone, but without a regular 2D touchscreen or look and feel? How would you design this fresh, ‘nicer’ way of calling and being called using wearable tech? How does it work? </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Describe the concept in around 75-150 words </li>
                <li>Describe the interaction. How is space used and how do people use your solution? </li>
                <li>Which sensors are used and what do you sense in the environment and/or users? </li>
                <li>Which actuators are used, what response does the system give the user? </li>
                <li>Make sure you give attention to the product design; use of materials, colors, size, etc. </li>
                <li>Support the concept with multiple images (sketches, digital design, etc.)</li>
                </ul>
                <h4 id="research">Research</h4>
                <p>When doing research on wearables, I discovered a fundraiser campaign for a product that I was very interested in.</p>
                <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjOHyTyuyW0?"></iframe>
                <p>This is the Motion Sonic by Sony, a piece of wearable technology specifically designed for musicians. This technology takes common musical effects like reverb, low- and hi-pass filters, vibrato, etc. and associates it with a gesture. The wearable then reads the gestures using a motion sensor inside of the wearable to add the effect to whatever instrument you’re playing. This product sadly never released to the public, but I would have loved to see how people would have interacted with it. <br><br> What I like most about this product is how natural and intuitive the gestures look for musicians. At the start of the video, you see the keyboard player getting a vibrato and pitch bend effect by wiggling his finger on the keys in much the same way a guitarist would get this effect without the use of this device. I would imagine musicians would very easily be able to incorporate this technology into their own playing because of how intuitive the gestures are.</p>
