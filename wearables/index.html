                <h4 id="custom-wearable-concept-for-blind-people">Custom wearable concept for blind people</h4>
                <p>When you think about it, blind people don&#39;t really have a reason to carry around a smartphone with a giant screen. Some time ago, I saw this video about how blind people use their phones using a screen reader, which does exactly what it sounds like, it reads the screen aloud to the user. This got me thinking about a more efficient way to do this and I thought &quot;<em>Why not convert all the visual information to auditory information and take the whole visual element out of the equation?</em>&quot;. </p>
                <p>Here are a few ways this wearable could be used by a blind person.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Accept and decline calls by tapping or double-tapping the braille Y/N buttons on the side of the wearable</li>
                <li>Send and receive texts by using the microphone to convert speech into text <em>(typing was never really an option anyways...)</em></li>
                <li>Ask questions to the built-in assistant and receive answers just like you would with Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Since the headset is bone-conducting it doesn&#39;t also impair the user&#39;s hearing, which is very important for staying aware of their surroundings.</p>
                <h4 id="research">Research</h4>
                <p>When doing research on wearables, I discovered a fundraiser campaign for a product that I was very interested in.</p>
                <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjOHyTyuyW0?"></iframe>
                <p>This is the Motion Sonic by Sony, a piece of wearable technology specifically designed for musicians. This technology takes common musical effects like reverb, low- and hi-pass filters, vibrato, etc. and associates it with a gesture. The wearable then reads the gestures using a motion sensor inside of the wearable to add the effect to whatever instrument youâ€™re playing. This product sadly never released to the public, but I would have loved to see how people would have interacted with it. <br><br> What I like most about this product is how natural and intuitive the gestures look for musicians. At the start of the video, you see the keyboard player getting a vibrato and pitch bend effect by wiggling his finger on the keys in much the same way a guitarist would get this effect without the use of this device. I would imagine musicians would very easily be able to incorporate this technology into their own playing because of how intuitive the gestures are.</p>
